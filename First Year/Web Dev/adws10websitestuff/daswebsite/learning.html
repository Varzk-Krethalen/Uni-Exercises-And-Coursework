						<h3> Week 12: --- </h3>

					<p> Again, I just cleaned up errors in HTML and CSS. Some of this was done with my
						great friend, www.w3schools.com. </p>

						<h3> Week 11: ~~~ </h3>

					<p>This week was about the same, but I also added a range to the form, which wasn't
					fully explained in the tutorial, using http://html5doctor.com/the-output-element/</p>

						<h3> Week 9: ~~~ </h3> 
					</header>
					<p> This week I, obviously, did the tutorial, which was very challenging because
						it just didn't work. I also added a fixed menu bar, using info from 'http://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_topnav.asp.</p>

						<h3> Week 8: --- </h3>
					</header>
					<p> This week I did my best to optimise my images, cutting them down a bit, but
						I don't have photoshop, so I did my best manually then ran them through a lovely
						tool from www.imageoptimizer.net. I also added a nice background gradient.</p>

						<h3> Week 7: ~~~ </h3> 
					</header>
					<p> This week I conquered flexible images! They now resize as the page does, and
						move around, and stuff. They are, in a word, fluid. I didn't need to use iframes,
						 though. Maybe next time. This time, I don't have a video.</p>

						<h3> Week 6: --- </h3>
					</header>
					<p> This week was fun, in that I found it really quite challenging - I found it
					strangely to wrap my head around the mechanics of multi-column flowing websites.
					Nonetheless, I did manage to get it basically working, and have indeed added it
					to my learning journal page - this can be seen in the links to the side, though
					it took quite some time to remake the html surrounding that, and I'm still unsure
					about how the links seem to have extra 'stuff' around them. I think. by and large,
					and with some testing on my available devices, the website is now more mobile
					friendly, but said devices are not the newest, so I can't be sure. Didn't manage
					to get flexible images.

						<h3> Week 5: ~~~ </h3> 
					</header>
					<p> This week I learned about how a web browser unfortunately does not hold every
					font in the world, and how we must therefore use fallback fonts in case the user
					does not have any nice ones. Nonetheless, I will stick with nice fonts as my main,
					I think. Found out how to use google fonts, too, after a little bit of a misspelling
					issue.
					I then learned how to better style my text, with things like indenting - which I did
					add - and learned how margins merge. What was really nice is that I found out how to
					add those giant quote marks to a blockquote - wooo!
					Finally, I kinda learned how float works - still cannot get it to properly float without
					having the first line of text above the image. Oh well.
					</p>
					<p> I learned to: </p>
					<ol>
						<li> More correctly define fonts. </li>
						<li> Use web fonts. </li>
						<li> Style my text all nice. </li>
						<li> Float images, kind of. </li>
					</ol>

						<h3> Week 4: --- </h3>
					</header>
					<p> This week I learned how to attach CSS to a web page, and to do some basic CSS,
					as covered in the tutorial, such as color, font-family, margin, font-size. I also
					learned about how we can measure a web page in pixels, and therefore change visuals
					based on that. Especially important is that I learned how we can use id and class to
					give specific styles to individual or grouped elements - such as using a wrapper.
					I also learned how to make my links pretty, and how I could validate the CSS. Turned
					out just fine.
					</p>
					<p> I learned to: </p>
					<ol>
						<li> Attach CSS to a page. </li>
						<li> Alter said CSS, and create my own on a basic level. </li>
						<li> Style with Id and Class. </li>
						<li> Validate CSS for a website. </li>
					</ol>

						<h3> Week 3: ~~~ </h3> 
					</header>
					<p> Published <time datetime="2016-10-21">October 21st, 2016</time></p>
					<p> This week I didn't do much that was especially difficult - I prettied it all up,
						however. A bit, anyway. I altered some elements so that they were in their various
						section elements correctly - e.g. putting the page links in a nav tag. I mostly
						changed the main page, but I put some time into creating a timetable table on this
						page too. By and large, tables seem way too much effort for what you get. Is there
						no easier way? I added the html5 logo to the main page, and linked that to the source
						logo page on w3. I also added some quoted text about what html and css are. I changed
						the html5 link list into a definition list too.</p>
					<p> I learned to: </p>
					<ol>
						<li> Add links to an image. </li>
						<li> Create more types of list - specifically definition. </li>
						<li> Create a table, and format it a little.</li>
						<li> Create quoted text. </li>
					</ol>

						<h3> Week 2: --- </h3>
					</header>
					<p> Published <time datetime="2016-10-14">October 14th, 2016</time></p>
					<p> This week I realised that I'd done some things in advance, such as the image.
						However, I still had to add the caption stuffs, and define the image better,
						using the dimension attributes. I also added the extra top-bottom links to the 
						learning journal page, and reversed the order of weekly posts to have the
						earliest posts at the bottom. This does, however, mean that I have lots of lorem
						ipsum before you get there. I also completed this post and the week one post,
						and added lists to the end of the main prose, as well as adding publication dates,
						for which the reasoning is slightly lost on me. Nonetheless, I did at least find
						out how to correctly add email links, which I did on the contact page. </p>
					<p> I learned to: </p>
					<ol>
						<li> More correctly insert images into a page. </li>
						<li> Add more in-page links than are probably needed. </li>
						<li> Create proper email links that work on a click. </li>
						<li> Put in a time with the time tag. </li>
					</ol>

						<h3> Week 1: --- </h3>
					</header>
					<p> Published <time datetime="2016-10-07">October 7th, 2016</time></p>
					<p> This week I finished the first tutorial, which I found fairly easy once I'd
						got used to HTML again. I've ended up with a four page site, with a main
						page leading to the three needed, and links between each. I created templates
						for each weekly post, filled with lorem ipsum, and inserted a list of links
						to each post, with href anchors. I also have space for extra information, and
						a group of HTML5 tools on the main page (which has a rather badly drawn picture). 
						The tutorial and contact pages are currently empty. It all looks horrible,
						naturally. </p>
					<p> I learned to: </p>
					<ol>
						<li> Set up a website folder in the Web$ workspace. </li>
						<li> Validate HMTL using the W3C tool. </li>
						<li> To stuff words into the weekly post. </li>
						<li> Do things like links a week early. </li>
					</ol>
