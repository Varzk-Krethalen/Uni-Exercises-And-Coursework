				<h1> A Tutorial - Easy Meals for a Student </h1>
				<p> This is my tutorial page, wherein I shall place information pertaining to the creation
					of three simple and fairly cheap meals to carry a student throughout the day - these
					are not, however, at all definitive, and I recommend you find at least variations upon
					the given options.

				<section class="wavyborder"> <h2> Breakfast - Cereal</h2>
					<p> <img src="images/cerealready.jpg" alt="" class="fluid"/>
						In this image we can see the basic requirements for our first meal - cereal.
						Firstly, we have the most important part, a bowl - after all, we need to put
						it <em> somewhere </em>. Then, of course, we have the dry cereal itself, and
						the revitalisng, nourishing milk. Mmmm.
					</p>
					<p class="clear"></p>
					<p> <img src="images/cerealpour.jpg" alt="" class="fluid"/>
						In this image, you can see the combination of the three, with the dry cereal
						already inside the bowl, and the milk being poured in, by the lovely me. Now,
						you should be careful here - don't fill the bowl much more than halfway with
						cereal, and never do more than enough milk that the top layer begins to float.
						Naturally, keep the overall level a centimetre or so below the rim of your
						crockery, unless you really like cleaning. Now, just grab a spoon and dig in!
					</p>

				</section> 
				<section class="wavyborder"> <h2> Lunch- Pitta Bread</h2>
					<p> <img src="images/pittaready.jpg" alt="" class="fluid"/>
						This second meal is specifically for lunch, though like all these meals you can
						theoretically have it at any time - these are arranged in an order dictated by
						common sense, but feel free to ignore it. What we want to make is effectively a
						pitta bread sandwich. We require the pitta, obviously, a knife for cutting and
						spreading, as well as whatever you wish to put in the pitta bread - in my case,
						a nice spread and some pork luncheon meat. 
					</p>
					<p class="clear"></p>
					<p> <img src="images/pittadone.jpg" alt="" class="fluid"/>
						You will need to toast the pitta until
						it is on the verge of crispiness, and then spread the spread evenly spread across
						the inside of the pitta. Then, add any other filling. Finally, it should end up
						vaguely similar to the image on the right - I suggest you eat it at this point.
						</p>

				<section class="wavyborder"> <h2> Tea - Pasta Stuff</h2>
					<p> <img src="images/pastaready.jpg" alt="" class="fluid"/>
						Our final meal in this series is slightly more complicated, but has far more
						opportunities for your own preferred variation, being a pasta dish. Here you
						can see the ingredients we shall be using - pasta (which can be any type),
						sausages, cheese, and a sauce - here I have used a korma curry sauce, because
						it's what I had available. Again, this is a dish that can easily be adjusted to
						your taste. Keep in mind, however, that the quantities here are for 2 very hungry
						people.
					</p>
					<p class="clear"></p>
					<p> <img src="images/choppedsausage.jpg" alt="" class="fluid"/>
						Now, first thing you're going to want to do, is cook your sausages - this will
						usually only be about twenty minutes - similar to pasta cooking time. Very convenient.
						As such, you will want to start cooking your pasta at the same time. Once the sausages
						are cooked, you should remove them from the oven (and turn it off) and chop them into
						rough quarters. Your pasta should now be cooked, or close to. Wait if needed, then
						drain it.
					</p>
					<p class="clear"></p>
					<p> <img src="images/stirringpasta.jpg" alt="" class="fluid"/>
						Finally, tip the sauce, cheese, sausages and any other stuff you want into the pasta.
						Mix. Vigorously. Keep it on the heat for a few seconds to even more thoroughly <del>
						burn</del> melt your cheese. Once all mixed, however, it is effectively done. At this
						point, you can decant it into a dish of your choosing and eat it. Then again, you can
						add extras, such as any herbs and spices you have. Personally, we also added an egg
						on the top, which worked surprisingly well. Anyhow, good luck, and try not to give
						yourself food poisoning.
